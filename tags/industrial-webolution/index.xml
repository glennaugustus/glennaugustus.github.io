In this final part of the series I look at daily life, community and contact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>class Consumer { int money = 1; String product = &amp;ldquo;anything&amp;rdquo;; }&lt;code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Industrial Revolution, to a large degree, created consumer goods, or at least created a lot more consumers. Demand for goods excited the economy, which created jobs, which provided wages for men, women (and children) who were inspired to emulate their &amp;ldquo;social superiors&amp;rdquo; through the purchase of clothing and a wide variety of fashion accessories. (Pretending a class system didn&amp;rsquo;t exist would not accurately reflect the time.) Items that would have been grown or made at home, such as butter, milk, vegetables and lots of alcohol, were now available in shops. Today, the creation of the consumer class has expanded to encompass just about everyone on the planet. Virtually ubiquitous, although not equal, access to the Internet has been made possible through the recycling of handsets. Excluding yourself from this technowash is a lifestyle choice that raises eyebrows. We are now in a consumer world where the products are so vast in variety that it would seem everything has been invented &amp;ndash; until someone changes the surface to which today&amp;rsquo;s products are attached and we again need a new version of Tetris.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Industrial Webolution, Part 2: Power and Economics</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 11:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://glennaugustus.com/posts/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/">part one of this series&lt;/a> I looked at how the evolution of tools is providing the ecosystem for creativity. In this part I look at how today’s changes in power and economics are also amplified echoes of the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="power">Power&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Power, Fuel, Energy. Your instant view on the meaning of these words is probably as much a product of the decade you attended high school as it is for any definition from the dictionary. If you are teen of the 70&amp;rsquo;s they probably bring images of coal mines, the 80’s oil refineries, 90’s renewables/wind farms and after the millennium, millions upon millions of mobile phone batteries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Industrial Webolution, Part 1: Tools</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-goal">The Goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this series of posts I am going to try to justify why I think we are entering a new age of technology. This is not about dreams, forecasts or predictions, it&amp;rsquo;s not about flying cars, telepathy or time travel, this is about what we can do today and how it shares striking parallels with our history allowing the many innovators to flourish due to the acts of a relative few. The historians among you will need to forgive me as I wield a poorly aimed keyboard through a house of stacked cards on the subject, however, the characteristics of the industrial revolution can be categorized into a few areas, namely tooling, power, economics and the daily life of a typical citizen of an industrialized country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
