&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Some people can read &lt;em>War and Peace&lt;/em> and come away thinking itâ€™s a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The line is profound, meaningful on many levels. It is in fact ironic to consider that 561,093 words might convey something of limited value to an audience and, conversely 35 words can inform and influence an entire generation. Thought-provoking as that may be, you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering, how does that relate to any kind of technology perspective? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the idea that, just because there is an abundance of something, its sum may not have inherently greater value &amp;ndash; and let&amp;rsquo;s apply this consideration to lines of code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Server? What server? Becoming serverless</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/server-what-server-becoming-serverless/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Aug 2016 21:19:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/server-what-server-becoming-serverless/</guid><description>&lt;p>Did you turn away from your terminal and miss Infrastructure as a Service? Well, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, as there is a new paradigm for the techno-hungry audience â€“ and for a change, this one actually has something new about it! Most technology trends are re-manufactured from the last trend that did not gain the traction that its primary sponsors intended. When I say &amp;ldquo;new,&amp;rdquo; of course it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;new new.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a way of working that is enabled by the confluence of existing technologies that have been packaged in such a way that its use can be widely adopted. Sometimes, working in IT reminds me of a great line from the TV show &amp;ldquo;The Big Bang Theory&amp;rdquo; in which Penny asks, &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s new in the world of physics?&amp;rdquo; To which Leonard simply replies, &amp;ldquo;Nothing.&amp;rdquo; However, being totally new is no strong measure of the potential for disruption, and this has some real potential for disrupting the way apps and microservices consume the infrastructure foundation of the Internet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
