The topic was around the shift to digital health. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FemiLadega">Femi Ladega&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanHushon">Dan Hushon&lt;/a> did a great job explaining the engagement between healthcare provider and patient on the care journey and the digital transformation occurring in this exciting field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the hangout, the conversation moved onto crowdchat where some awesome questions got posed and everyone did their best to make worthwhile contributions.

By far the biggest example in recent years is Cloud. In fact because the renaming was so rife, it generated its own buzzword: &amp;ldquo;Cloudwashing.&amp;rdquo; It would seem that any product or service that had a network connection was, in some way, a Cloud.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
