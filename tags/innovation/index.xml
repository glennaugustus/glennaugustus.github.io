When I re-read my take on &lt;a href="https://glennaugustus.com/post/on-servers-serendipity-and-superman">Servers, Serendipidy and Superman&lt;/a> it seemed like a great idea to draw some parallels between the past and the future with another movie classic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a moment of cinematic history, etched into the collective consciousness of my generations (at least), where a bewildered quasi teenager uncovers an unexpected discovery. Michael J. Fox, as Marty McFly, utters a line that might just encapsulate a profound truth about innovation:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On servers, serendipity and Superman</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/on-servers-serendipity-and-superman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2017 14:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/on-servers-serendipity-and-superman/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a fantastic line in the 1978 film &lt;em>Superman&lt;/em>, penned by Mario Puzo of &lt;em>Godfather&lt;/em> fame and delivered flawlessly by the actor Gene Hackman as the perfect nemesis, Lex Luthor:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Some people can read &lt;em>War and Peace&lt;/em> and come away thinking it’s a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The line is profound, meaningful on many levels. It is in fact ironic to consider that 561,093 words might convey something of limited value to an audience and, conversely 35 words can inform and influence an entire generation. Thought-provoking as that may be, you&amp;rsquo;re probably wondering, how does that relate to any kind of technology perspective? Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the idea that, just because there is an abundance of something, its sum may not have inherently greater value &amp;ndash; and let&amp;rsquo;s apply this consideration to lines of code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Industrial Webolution, Part 2: Power and Economics</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 11:55:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/</guid><description>&lt;p>In &lt;a href="https://glennaugustus.com/posts/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/">part one of this series&lt;/a> I looked at how the evolution of tools is providing the ecosystem for creativity. In this part I look at how today’s changes in power and economics are also amplified echoes of the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="power">Power&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Power, Fuel, Energy. Your instant view on the meaning of these words is probably as much a product of the decade you attended high school as it is for any definition from the dictionary. If you are teen of the 70&amp;rsquo;s they probably bring images of coal mines, the 80’s oil refineries, 90’s renewables/wind farms and after the millennium, millions upon millions of mobile phone batteries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Industrial Webolution, Part 1: Tools</title><link>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 11:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-goal">The Goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this series of posts I am going to try to justify why I think we are entering a new age of technology. This is not about dreams, forecasts or predictions, it&amp;rsquo;s not about flying cars, telepathy or time travel, this is about what we can do today and how it shares striking parallels with our history allowing the many innovators to flourish due to the acts of a relative few. The historians among you will need to forgive me as I wield a poorly aimed keyboard through a house of stacked cards on the subject, however, the characteristics of the industrial revolution can be categorized into a few areas, namely tooling, power, economics and the daily life of a typical citizen of an industrialized country.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
