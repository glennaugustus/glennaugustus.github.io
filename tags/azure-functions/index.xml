Well, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, as there is a new paradigm for the techno-hungry audience â€“ and for a change, this one actually has something new about it! Most technology trends are re-manufactured from the last trend that did not gain the traction that its primary sponsors intended. When I say &amp;ldquo;new,&amp;rdquo; of course it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;new new.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a way of working that is enabled by the confluence of existing technologies that have been packaged in such a way that its use can be widely adopted. Sometimes, working in IT reminds me of a great line from the TV show &amp;ldquo;The Big Bang Theory&amp;rdquo; in which Penny asks, &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s new in the world of physics?&amp;rdquo; To which Leonard simply replies, &amp;ldquo;Nothing.&amp;rdquo; However, being totally new is no strong measure of the potential for disruption, and this has some real potential for disrupting the way apps and microservices consume the infrastructure foundation of the Internet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
