(Pretending a class system didn\u0026rsquo;t exist would not accurately reflect the time.) Items that would have been grown or made at home, such as butter, milk, vegetables and lots of alcohol, were now available in shops. Today, the creation of the consumer class has expanded to encompass just about everyone on the planet. Virtually ubiquitous, although not equal, access to the Internet has been made possible through the recycling of handsets. Excluding yourself from this technowash is a lifestyle choice that raises eyebrows. We are now in a consumer world where the products are so vast in variety that it would seem everything has been invented \u0026ndash; until someone changes the surface to which today\u0026rsquo;s products are attached and we again need a new version of Tetris.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["Industrial Webolution","Daily Life","Community","Technology","Internet","Consumerism"],"title":"The Industrial Webolution, Part 3: Daily Life","type":"post","url":"/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-3-daily-life/","weight":0,"wordcount":958},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Part of the Industrial Webolution series, this post explores how shifts in power and economics echo the industrial revolution, shaping technology, society, and the global economy.","date":1446724510,"description":"Part of the Industrial Webolution series, this post explores how shifts in power and economics echo the industrial revolution, shaping technology, society, and the global economy.","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"Part of the Industrial Webolution series, this post explores how shifts in power and economics echo the industrial revolution, shaping technology, society, and the global economy.","excerpt_text":"Part of the Industrial Webolution series, this post explores how shifts in power and economics echo the industrial revolution, shaping technology, society, and the global economy.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":1200,"html":"Part of the Industrial Webolution series, this post explores how shifts in power and economics echo the industrial revolution, shaping technology, society, and the global economy.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446724510,"objectID":"caf08ea518719cdd18ce03239091992f","permalink":"https://glennaugustus.com/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/","publishdate":"2015-11-05T11:55:10Z","readingtime":6,"relpermalink":"/post/the-industrial-webolution-part-2-power-and-economics/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIn \u003ca href=\"/posts/the-industrial-webolution-part-1-tools/\"\u003epart one of this series\u003c/a\u003e I looked at how the evolution of tools is providing the ecosystem for creativity.

Using block storage can seem easy, but it\u0026rsquo;s a question of scalability of administration, managing a small number of volumes can be straightforward, managing 10000 volumes?

It is worth considering though that the bare metal market for another market segment is accelerating, namely ODM or ‘Other Device Manufacturers’ these are the firms which make the white box servers for some of the public cloud players and also provide the bare bones for functional appliances.

As each abstraction layer is commoditized it allows the layer above to implement the ‘southbound’ layers in generic API type models, driving the further commoditization and common capability across providers. One of the interesting areas here, and why a standard may be needed, is how the abstracted component can advertise unique capabilities or services – take for example that a particular container or VM could offer certain scale-up features, or proximity to an existing dataset - would it not be of interest to the domain broker to be able to serve not just generic workload execution engines but ones that support the context of the business request? The open standards bodies that come together are clearly excited in this space – any subject that has a high level of cross technology magnetism such as Docker, will iteratively divide and unite the community very quickly, leaving what has been demonstrated in the past many times as the most generally acceptable solution to move forward, not always the best from a subjective viewpoint, but acceptable.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["compute workload abstraction","containers","virtualization","standards","security","licensing","Docker","SDN","NFV"],"title":"Compute Workload Abstraction - Part 3, or Rules are there to contain the fun","type":"post","url":"/post/compute-workload-abstraction-part-3-rules-are-there-to-contain-the-fun/","weight":0,"wordcount":647},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Part of a series on compute workload abstraction, this post explores the evolution of virtualization, the rise of containers, and how abstraction is reshaping application deployment and scalability.","date":1438018802,"description":"Part of a series on compute workload abstraction, this post explores the evolution of virtualization, the rise of containers, and how abstraction is reshaping application deployment and scalability.","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"Part of a series on compute workload abstraction, this post explores the evolution of virtualization, the rise of containers, and how abstraction is reshaping application deployment and scalability.","excerpt_text":"Part of a series on compute workload abstraction, this post explores the evolution of virtualization, the rise of containers, and how abstraction is reshaping application deployment and scalability.","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":600,"html":"Part of a series on compute workload abstraction, this post explores the evolution of virtualization, the rise of containers, and how abstraction is reshaping application deployment and scalability.","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1438018802,"objectID":"eaf072838cce891954e06af68c1dfdac","permalink":"https://glennaugustus.com/post/compute-workload-abstraction-part-2-virtualization-is-dead-long-live-virtualization/","publishdate":"2015-07-27T17:40:02Z","readingtime":3,"relpermalink":"/post/compute-workload-abstraction-part-2-virtualization-is-dead-long-live-virtualization/","section":"post","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis is part two of a series exploring the topic of compute workload abstraction.

It’s a common thought that the sole business case for virtualization was derived from the inefficient use of existing hardware resources, and of course this is part of the story. But the unsung hero of virtualization was the usage of a simplified set of resources from the hardware abstraction layer. This meant that when an application was running in a virtual machine there was a good chance that problems in the operating system were down to an exhausted resource or poor configuration, not down to a bad driver or a kernel fault. The combination of vendor testing and almost instant worldwide feedback created an ecosystem where any significant problems were either removed before release or patched before you had a chance to download it anyway! Not all problems were eradicated, but the reduction in variants at the hypervisor level created a far more standard environment in which operating systems and applications could live in relative harmony.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":["virtualization","containers","workload abstraction","cloud","technology"],"title":"Compute Workload Abstraction - Part 1, or One HAL of a Story","type":"post","url":"/post/compute-workload-abstraction-part-1-or-one-hal-of-a-story/","weight":0,"wordcount":543},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"search/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":100,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8946788897930c0c0c39fbfcd30ff2e4","permalink":"https://glennaugustus.com/search/placeholder/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":0,"relpermalink":"/search/placeholder/","section":"search","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"search","url":"/search/placeholder/","weight":0,"wordcount":0},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":"Our Commenting Policy, Fostering a Positive Community","date":-62135596800,"description":"Our Commenting Policy, Fostering a Positive Community","dir":"/","excerpt_html":"Our Commenting Policy, Fostering a Positive Community","excerpt_text":"Our Commenting Policy, Fostering a Positive Community","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"Our Commenting Policy, Fostering a Positive Community","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7f5c4cf43c11905badc1a6ded15e5906","permalink":"https://glennaugustus.com/comment-policy/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/comment-policy/","section":"","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWe welcome your contributions to the discussions on our articles and aim to create a space that is valuable and engaging for everyone.
